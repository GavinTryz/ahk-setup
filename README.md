# Gavin's AHK Setup
Various hotkeys I have set up for my personal use. Storing them here for whenever I swap to a new PC.

## Usage
1. Clone repo contents directly into `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` by doing the following:
    - Navigate to the folder in cmd/powershell/wsl/whatever
    - Use `git clone <git url> .`
2. Delete README.md

Assuming you have AHK installed, it will automatically start on bootup
